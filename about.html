              <p class="white">United Way is a worldwide non-religious movement that envisions a world where every individual has an opportunity to succeed, and entire communities thrive as a result. 1 in 5 children from low socio-economic backgrounds start school unprepared
                with the basics to succeed. (AEDI Index 2009.) Research shows that the experiences of children’s early years can have strong effects on their future, with implications for their health, development and ability to earn. The quality of an
                individual’s education has a profound and lasting impact on the person’s ability to succeed in the world. United Way provides leadership in early childhood learning, quality child care and school readiness. We help deliver programs that
                embed greater social cohesion in disadvantaged communities by engaging mothers who are socially isolated and where positive parenting skills may be lacking.</p>

                <p class="white double-space">United Way was formed in 1887 when a Denver woman, a priest, two ministers and a rabbi recognised the need for cooperative action to address their city’s welfare problems. They put their heads together to plan the first united campaign
                  for ten health and welfare agencies and created an organisation to serve as an agent to collect funds for local charities, as well as to coordinate relief services, counsel and refer clients to cooperating agencies and make emergency
                  assistance grants in cases which could not be referred.</p>

                <p class="white">Kerry is community focused having begun her volunteering in the community at 12 years old. She has a positive energy which she has brought to United Way and driven the success of the United We Read pilots and overseen the launch of the
                  Read Aloud, Every Child Every Day initiative.</p>
                <p class="white">As a parent of 3 children Kerry is passionate about the value of reading to children and the subsequent platform that this will provide to a child’s education and therefore support that child to reach for their individual potential. Kerry’s
                  work history has seen her work as a change leader and driver of successful and profitable business outcomes and community support programs. Additionally, Kerry has broad experience in managing staff, volunteers and program delivery for
                  children.
